description: Talkable Social Referrals helps brands acquire new customers with endorsements
  from current customers. As the web becomes more person-centric, consumers trust
  the recommendations of their friends more than traditional advertising. By optimizing
  for higher conversion rates and identifying social influencers, weve achieved as
  high as a 58% lift in new sales.
